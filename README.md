# Verifier

A simple Go program for domain verification. This project was built as a learning exercise, inspired by [this YouTube video by Akhil Sharma ](https://youtu.be/9E4UEsWpYvM?list=PL5dTjWUk_cPYztKD7WxVFluHvpBNM28N9). Big thanks to the creator for the valuable content!

## Features
- Verifies if a domain is active and reachable.
  
## TODO
- Add support for checking multiple domains simultaneously.
- Transform this into a CLI tool for ease of use.
- Eventually deploy as a web application.
